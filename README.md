Oracle Database on Docker
===============
Sample Docker build files to facilitate installation, configuration, and environment setup for DevOps users. For more information about Oracle Database please see the [Oracle Database Online Documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/database/121/index.htm).

**IMPORTANT:** The resulting images will be an image with the Oracle binaries installed. On first startup of the container a new database will be created, the following lines highlight when the database is ready to be used:

You may extend the image with your own Dockerfile and create the users and tablespaces that you may need.

The character set for the database is set during creating of the database. 11g Express Edition supports only UTF-8. You can set the character set for the Standard Edition 2 and Enterprise Edition during the first run of your container and may keep separate folders containing different tablespaces with different character sets.

### Running Oracle Database in a Docker container

#### Running Oracle Database Enterprise and Standard Edition 2 in a Docker container
To run your Oracle Database Docker image use the **docker run** command as follows:

	docker run --name <container name> \
	-p <host port>:1521 -p <host port>:5500 \
	-e ORACLE_SID=<your SID> \
	-e ORACLE_PDB=<your PDB name> \
	-e ORACLE_PWD=<your database passwords> \
	-e ORACLE_CHARACTERSET=<your character set> \
	-v [<host mount point>:]/opt/oracle/oradata \
	oracle/database:12.2.0.1-ee
	
	Parameters:
	   --name:        The name of the container (default: auto generated)
	   -p:            The port mapping of the host port to the container port. 
	                  Two ports are exposed: 1521 (Oracle Listener), 5500 (OEM Express)
	   -e ORACLE_SID: The Oracle Database SID that should be used (default: ORCLCDB)
	   -e ORACLE_PDB: The Oracle Database PDB name that should be used (default: ORCLPDB1)
	   -e ORACLE_PWD: The Oracle Database SYS, SYSTEM and PDB_ADMIN password (default: auto generated)
	   -e ORACLE_CHARACTERSET:
	                  The character set to use when creating the database (default: AL32UTF8)
	   -v /opt/oracle/oradata
	                  The data volume to use for the database.
	                  Has to be owned by the Unix user "oracle" or set appropriately.
	                  If omitted the database will not be persisted over container recreation.
	   -v /opt/oracle/scripts/startup | /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/startup
	                  Optional: A volume with custom scripts to be run after database startup.
	                  For further details see the "Running scripts after setup and on startup" section below.
	   -v /opt/oracle/scripts/setup | /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/setup
	                  Optional: A volume with custom scripts to be run after database setup.
	                  For further details see the "Running scripts after setup and on startup" section below.

Once the container has been started and the database created you can connect to it just like to any other database:

	sqlplus sys/<your password>@//localhost:1521/<your SID> as sysdba
	sqlplus system/<your password>@//localhost:1521/<your SID>
	sqlplus pdbadmin/<your password>@//localhost:1521/<Your PDB name>

The Oracle Database inside the container also has Oracle Enterprise Manager Express configured. To access OEM Express, start your browser and follow the URL:

	https://localhost:5500/em/

**NOTE**: Oracle Database bypasses file system level caching for some of the files by using the `O_DIRECT` flag. It is not advised to run the container on a file system that does not support the `O_DIRECT` flag.

#### Changing the admin accounts passwords

On the first startup of the container a random password will be generated for the database if not provided. You can find this password in the output line:  
	
	ORACLE PASSWORD FOR SYS, SYSTEM AND PDBADMIN:

The password for those accounts can be changed via the **docker exec** command. **Note**, the container has to be running:

	docker exec <container name> ./setPassword.sh <your password>

#### Running Oracle Database Express Edition in a Docker container
To run your Oracle Database Express Edition Docker image use the **docker run** command as follows:

	docker run --name <container name> \
	--shm-size=1g \
	-p 1521:1521 -p 8080:8080 \
	-e ORACLE_PWD=<your database passwords> \
	-v [<host mount point>:]/u01/app/oracle/oradata \
	oracle/database:11.2.0.2-xe
	
	Parameters:
	   --name:        The name of the container (default: auto generated)
	   --shm-size:    Amount of Linux shared memory
	   -p:            The port mapping of the host port to the container port.
	                  Two ports are exposed: 1521 (Oracle Listener), 8080 (APEX)
	   -e ORACLE_PWD: The Oracle Database SYS, SYSTEM and PDB_ADMIN password (default: auto generated)

	   -v /u01/app/oracle/oradata
	                  The data volume to use for the database.
	                  Has to be owned by the Unix user "oracle" or set appropriately.
	                  If omitted the database will not be persisted over container recreation.
	   -v /u01/app/oracle/scripts/startup | /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
	                  Optional: A volume with custom scripts to be run after database startup.
	                  For further details see the "Running scripts after setup and on startup" section below.
	   -v /u01/app/oracle/scripts/setup | /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
	                  Optional: A volume with custom scripts to be run after database startup.
	                  For further details see the "Running scripts after setup and on startup" section below.

There are two ports that are exposed in this image:
* 1521 which is the port to connect to the Oracle Database.
* 8080 which is the port of Oracle Application Express (APEX).

On the first startup of the container a random password will be generated for the database if not provided. You can find this password in the output line:

	ORACLE PASSWORD FOR SYS AND SYSTEM:

**Note:** The ORACLE_SID for Express Edition is always `XE` and cannot be changed, hence there is no ORACLE_SID parameter provided for the XE build.

The password for those accounts can be changed via the **docker exec** command. **Note**, the container has to be running:
	docker exec oraclexe /u01/app/oracle/setPassword.sh <your password>

Once the container has been started you can connect to it just like to any other database:

	sqlplus sys/<your password>@//localhost:1521/XE as sysdba
	sqlplus system/<your password>@//localhost:1521/XE

### Running SQL*Plus in a Docker container
You may use the same Docker image you used to start the database, to run `sqlplus` to connect to it, for example:

	docker run --rm -ti oracle/database:12.2.0.1-ee sqlplus pdbadmin/<yourpassword>@//<db-container-ip>:1521/ORCLPDB1

Another option is to use `docker exec` and run `sqlplus` from within the same container already running the database:

	docker exec -ti <container name> sqlplus pdbadmin@ORCLPDB1

### Running scripts after setup and on startup
The docker images can be configured to run scripts after setup and on startup. Currently `sh` and `sql` extensions are supported.
For post-setup scripts just mount the volume `/opt/oracle/scripts/setup` or extend the image to include scripts in this directory.
For post-startup scripts just mount the volume `/opt/oracle/scripts/startup` or extend the image to include scripts in this directory.
Both of those locations are also represented under the symbolic link `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`. This is done to provide
synergy with other database Docker images. The user is free to decide whether he wants to put his setup and startup scripts
under `/opt/oracle/scripts` or `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`.

After the database is setup and/or started the scripts in those folders will be executed against the database in the container.
SQL scripts will be executed as sysdba, shell scripts will be executed as the current user. To ensure proper order it is
recommended to prefix your scripts with a number. For example `01_users.sql`, `02_permissions.sql`, etc.

**Note:** The startup scripts will also be executed after the first time database setup is complete.

The example below mounts the local directory myScripts to `/opt/oracle/myScripts` which is then searched for custom startup scripts:

    docker run --name oracle-ee -p 1521:1521 -v /home/oracle/myScripts:/opt/oracle/scripts/startup -v /home/oracle/oradata:/opt/oracle/oradata oracle/database:12.2.0.1-ee
    

## Known issues
* The [`overlay` storage driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/selectadriver/) on CentOS has proven to run into Docker bug #25409. We recommend using `btrfs` or `overlay2` instead. For more details see issue #317.

## Support
Oracle Database in single instance configuration is supported for Oracle Linux 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.
